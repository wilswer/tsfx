# TSFX

_TSFX -- Time Series Feature eXtraction_

## About

TSFX is a Python library for extracting features from time series data.
Inspired by the great [TSFresh](https://tsfresh.com/) library, TSFX aims to
provide a similar feature set focused on performance on large datasets.
In order to achieve this, TSFX is built on top of the
[Polars](https://pola.rs/) DataFrame library, and feature extractors are
implemented in Rust.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tsfx
```

## Usage

Below is a simple example of extracting features from a time series dataset:

```python
import polars as pl
from tsfx import (
    DynamicGroupBySettings,
    ExtractionSettings,
    FeatureSetting,
    extract_features,
)

df = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": ["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"],
        "val": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        "value": [4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
    },
).lazy()
settings = ExtractionSettings(
    grouping_col="id",
    feature_setting=FeatureSetting.Efficient,
    value_cols=["val", "value"],
)
gdf = extract_features(df, settings)
gdf = gdf.sort(by="id")
print(gdf)
```

which produces the following output:

```bash
shape: (3, 316)
┌─────┬────────┬─────────────┬───────────┬───┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐

### Extracting over a time window

An additional feature of TSFX is the ability to extract features over a time window.
Below is an example of extracting features over a 3 year window:

```python
import polars as pl
from tsfx import (
    DynamicGroupBySettings,
    ExtractionSettings,
    FeatureSetting,
    extract_features,
)
tdf = pl.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": ["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"],
        "time": [
            "2001-01-01",
            "2002-01-01",
            "2003-01-01",
            "2001-01-01",
            "2002-01-01",
            "2003-01-01",
            "2001-01-01",
            "2002-01-01",
            "2003-01-01",
        ],
        "val": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        "value": [4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
    },
).lazy()

dyn_settings = DynamicGroupBySettings(
    time_col="time",
    every="3y",
    period="3y",
    offset="0",
    datetime_format="%Y-%m-%d",
)
settings = ExtractionSettings(
    grouping_col="id",
    value_cols=["val", "value"],
    feature_setting=FeatureSetting.Efficient,
    dynamic_settings=dyn_settings,
)
gdf = extract_features(tdf, settings)
gdf = gdf.sort(by="id")
print(gdf)
```

which produces the following output:

```bash
shape: (3, 317)
